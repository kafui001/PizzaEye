Jupyter Notebook Containing the Deep Learning Algorithm for identifying the type of pizza (cheese vs. pepperoni vs. supreme) is in the foder "type_identification" --> "topping_recognition.ipynb"

Requirements.txt file in the "type_identification" folder has all the libraries including Fast AI and Pickle used in this study

Trained Model: "stage_topping.pkl" in the "Models" Folder is the trained Deep Learning Model that was exported to the Flask App

Run app.py to see the flask app on the local server
